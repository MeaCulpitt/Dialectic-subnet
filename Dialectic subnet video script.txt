[0:00-0:45] HOOK: The Black Box Problem

[VISUAL: Close-up on a ChatGPT interface generating a convincing but flawed legal argument. Text highlights in red as errors appear]

NARRATOR:
What if I told you that the most expensive AI mistake isn’t a hallucination…it’s a convincing mistake?

Right now, Large Language Models generate answers that sound perfect but collapse under scrutiny. In law, finance, and science, we’re flying blind—trusting reasoning we cannot verify.

[VISUAL: Shift to blockchain network visualization, nodes lighting up]

Centralized AI companies tell us to just trust their safety teams. But what if we could prove intelligence—not by asking an AI to be honest, but by paying strangers to prove it wrong?

This is Dialectic—Subnet [X] on Bittensor. Not a chatbot. An adversarial marketplace for truth.

[0:45-1:45] THE PROBLEM: Why We Can’t Trust Chain-of-Thought

[VISUAL: Split screen. Left: OpenAI o1 "thinking" in hidden gray box. Right: Text "Reasoning hidden for competitive reasons"]

NARRATOR:
Modern reasoning models hide their work. They show you the answer, but not the fragile logical steps that got them there.

[VISUAL: News headlines flashing—"Law Firm fined $5M for fake AI citations," "Trading algorithm logic flaw loses $2B"]

When errors cost millions, we need more than confidence scores. We need cryptographic proof of effort—a system where bad reasoning costs money and good reasoning earns it.

Enter Bittensor—and a new primitive: the adversarial subnet.

[1:45-2:45] THE SOLUTION: Three Players, One Truth

[VISUAL: Isometric diagram appearing. Three towers labeled: PROPOSER, CHALLENGER, VALIDATOR. Arrows showing TAO flow]

NARRATOR:
Dialectic isn’t just another AI subnet. It’s a triadic game with three distinct economic actors.

Meet the Proposers—miners who stake TAO to submit solutions with full Chain-of-Thought. But here’s the twist: they don’t just submit an answer. They submit a Merkle tree of reasoning—every logical step hashed and timestamped.

[VISUAL: Tree diagram animating. Root hash at top, branching down to lemmas]

Then come the Challengers. These are miners—or anyone—who hunt for specific flaws in those reasoning steps. They don’t just disagree; they stake TAO on exactly which branch of the tree is rotten.

Finally, Validators—the adjudicators. They don’t read everything. They use Stochastic Branch Verification—randomly sampling depths of the debate to verify logic with minimal compute.

If the Challenger is right, they capture the Proposer’s stake. If wrong, they lose their bet. This isn’t moderation. This is economic combat for logic.

[2:45-4:30] MECHANISM DEEP DIVE: The 12-Hour Cycle

[VISUAL: Circular clock animation dividing into phases]

NARRATOR:
Let’s walk through a live round. The clock starts.

Phase 1: Proposal [0-6 hours]
A client submits a problem: "Should Protocol X migrate its liquidity to this new bridge architecture?"

[VISUAL: Screen recording style—Terminal showing JSON input]

Proposer Miner Alpha generates a 20-step reasoning tree—evaluating bridge security, yield, and regulatory risk. They hash each step into a Merkle tree and commit the root to the blockchain.

Phase 2: Challenge [6-12 hours]
[VISUAL: Red alert pulse on one branch of the tree]

Miner Beta spots a flaw: Step 14 assumes the bridge’s multisig is 3-of-5, when it’s actually 2-of-7—a critical security downgrade.

Beta stakes 50 TAO specifically challenging that node. They submit a counter-argument with evidence.

Phase 3: Resolution [12-14 hours]
[VISUAL: Validator nodes zooming in on the disputed branch only]

Validators don’t read the full 20 steps. They verify:

Does Step 14 logically follow from Step 13?
Is Beta’s multisig claim factually correct?
Does this invalidate the final conclusion?
[VISUAL: TAO tokens flowing from Proposer to Challenger as "VICTORY" flashes]

Consensus reaches 80%: Beta wins. Alpha’s stake is slashed; Beta earns 40% of Alpha’s reward plus their initial stake back. Validators earn calibration fees.

[VISUAL: "Proof of Intelligence" certificate generating with transaction hash]

The client receives not just an answer, but a surviving reasoning tree—a cryptographic certificate that this logic has been stress-tested by economically motivated adversaries.

[4:30-6:00] THE ARCHITECTURE: Asymmetric Verification

[VISUAL: Technical diagram—left side heavy GPU cluster, right side lightweight laptop]

NARRATOR:
This works because of asymmetric verification—a concept borrowed from Proof-of-Work, but applied to cognition.

[VISUAL: Math overlay: O(n) vs O(log n)]

Proposers do the heavy lifting—O(n) compute to generate complex reasoning. Challengers do medium work—O(log n) to find specific flaws. Validators do lightweight work—sampling just O(sqrt n) to verify.

But the economics are reversed. Validators earn modestly but consistently. Challengers earn high variance—jackpots when they find critical bugs. Proposers earn the base rate, but only if their reasoning is bulletproof.

[VISUAL: Three-tier validator system showing Scout, Auditor, Arbiter]

We’ve built three validator tiers:

Scouts: Consumer GPUs checking basic coherence
Auditors: Heavy models for deep logic verification
Arbiters: High-stake experts for appeals
This creates a verification gradient—decentralized yet scalable.

[6:00-7:15] ANTI-GAMING: Why You Can’t Cheat

[VISUAL: Hacker trying various attacks, each blocked by shield icons]

NARRATOR:
“But wait,” you say, “what if I just spam challenges?”

Slashing Condition 1: Frivolous Challenge Penalty. If your challenge scores below 20% validity, you lose 5% of your stake to validators.

[VISUAL: Two miners colluding, then getting slashed]

“What if I collude with validators?”

Slashing Condition 2: Temporal Decay. Rewards drop exponentially for late challenges. And the Quadratic Voting mechanism means stake weight follows the square root—whales can’t dominate consensus.

[VISUAL: "Lazy Validation" detector scanning for empty votes]

“What if validators just vote randomly?”

Calibration Scoring: Validators are scored on how close they are to the eventual consensus. Vote against the majority when consensus is strong (>80%), and you face consensus divergence penalties—5% of your TAO slashed.

The system rewards being right, not just being first.
