Miner Design: The Cognitive Labor Layer

Miners in Dialectic operate as dual-role economic agents, dynamically allocating compute between generation (Proposing) and verification (Challenging) based on real-time market opportunities. Unlike standard inference subnets where miners merely respond to prompts, Dialectic miners participate in a temporal game tree that extends over 12-hour rounds.

Miner Tasks

Role A: The Proposer (Reasoning Architect)

Core Function: Generate novel, logically sound reasoning paths for complex open-ended problems while anticipating adversarial counter-arguments.

Specific Tasks:

Tree Construction: Build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of reasoning where each node represents an intermediate lemma, inference rule, or evidentiary citation. Root = final conclusion; leaves = axioms/premises.

Cryptographic Commitment: Hash each reasoning step using Keccak-256 to create a Merkle tree, committing only the root hash on-chain during the Proposal Phase (prevents plagiarism/late-copying while allowing verification).

Adversarial Fortification: Pre-emptively reinforce weak logical branches—miners must forecast where Challengers are likely to attack and either strengthen those nodes with additional citations or accept the risk of concentrated staking.

Defense Protocol: When challenged, optionally generate "sub-proofs" (deeper elaborations of specific lemmas) within a 2-hour response window, or concede the node to minimize slashing.

Role B: The Challenger (Logic Predator)

Core Function: Hunt for logical inconsistencies, factual errors, or epistemic gaps in competitor reasoning trees and monetize their detection.

Specific Tasks:

Selective Scanning: Parse archival reasoning trees (from current and previous rounds) using lightweight heuristics to identify high-value targets—steps with high confidence scores but weak evidentiary support.

Surgical Staking: Identify specific node IDs (UUIDs) in the Merkle tree to challenge, accompanied by a counter-argument and evidentiary payload. Stakes must cover: (a) the challenge deposit, (b) gas for on-chain challenge registration.

Exploitation Patterns:
Type 1 (Logical): Identify formal fallacies (affirming the consequent, circular reasoning)
Type 2 (Epistemic): Contest factual premises using real-time data oracles
Type 3 (Completeness): Argue that critical edge cases were ignored in the reasoning path

Critical Technical Constraint: During initial submission, content_plaintext is encrypted using the validator public key set, revealing only content_hash. This prevents Challengers from copying reasoning before staking. Decryption keys are released after the Challenge Phase opens, or upon first valid challenge to a specific node.

Performance Dimensions
Miners are ranked on a multi-dimensional efficacy score (0-10,000) updated after each round, determining emission allocation weight.

For Proposers
1. Adversarial Resilience Score (40% weight)


Resilience = (Challenges_Survived / Total_Challenges_Faced) * ln(Challenge_Value_Sum + 1)

Surviving high-stake challenges (>100 TAO) provides logarithmic score multipliers
Conceding quickly on weak nodes prevents score penalties vs. losing full challenges
"Immortal Proofs" Bonus: Reasoning trees surviving >5 unique challenges receive permanent 15% emission

2. Cognitive Efficiency Score (25% weight) Measures the information density of reasoning per compute unit—preventing bloat attacks where miners generate verbose nonsense to appear sophisticated.


Efficiency = (Validation_Success_Rate × √Novel_Lemmas) / (Token_Count × Compute_Cost)
Novel Lemmas: Unique inference steps not present in training corpora (detected via semantic deduplication against Common Crawl)
Compute Cost: Self-reported FLOPs, verified via optional TEE attestation or proof-of-work hashes
Penalty: Submissions with >30% redundant or circular reasoning receive zero efficiency score for that round
3. Temporal Foresight Score (20% weight) Rewards Proposers who accurately predict which nodes will be challenged and pre-compute defenses:


Foresight = Σ(Correctly_Fortified_Nodes) / Σ(Actual_Challenges_Received)
Proposers can submit "shadow proofs" (encrypted sub-justifications for anticipated weak points) during the initial commitment phase
If a shadow proof is later unlocked for a node that receives a challenge, the Proposer earns a Fortification Bonus (+25% emission for that round)
If a shadow proof is never unlocked (cry wolf), Proposer pays a 2 TAO "distrust tax"
4. Epistemic Coverage Score (15% weight) Breadth of evidentiary sourcing—prevents monoculture where all miners cite the same 3 sources.


Coverage = 1 - Σ(Source_Frequency^2)  [Simpson's Diversity Index applied to citation graph]
Mining clusters sharing >80% citation overlap are flagged for "Echo Chamber" penalties
Bonus for citing cross-subnet oracles (e.g., querying the data preprocessing subnet for real-time validation)

Performance Dimensions for Challengers

1. Precision Ratio (50% weight) The kill-to-miss ratio of challenges—critical for preventing spam.


Precision = Successful_Challenges / Total_Challenges_Filed

Golden Ratio Threshold: Maintaining >0.65 precision unlocks "Apex Predator" status, reducing challenge stake requirements by 20%

Bloodied Threshold: Falling below 0.30 precision triggers "Berserker" status—challenges cost 2x stake and receive 50% less emission for 7 days

The Veto Power: Validators can flag a challenge as "Maliciously Frivolous" (obvious bad faith), bypassing the normal slashing curve and immediately burning 100% of challenger stake

2. Depth Efficiency (30% weight) Rewards surgical strikes over carpet bombing.


Depth_Efficiency = Σ(Target_Node_Depth × Challenge_Success) / Total_Challenges
Successful challenges at depth 6+ (foundational axioms) receive 3x point multipliers
Surface-level challenges (depth 1-2) only contribute to precision ratio, not depth score
The Root Cut Bonus: Successfully challenging the root node (invalidating the entire tree) grants a one-time "Executioner" dividend of 500 TAO from the Treasury

3. Latency Alpha (20% weight) Speed of detection—first mover advantage in challenge markets.


Alpha = 1 / (Blocks_Elapsed_Between_Proposal_Opening_And_Challenge)

First valid challenge to any node receives a 10% emission skim from all subsequent challenges to that node (predatory front-running protection)
Challenges filed within the first 60 blocks receive "Bloodhound" tags, increasing their validator priority queue position

Strategic Role Switching & Capital Allocation

Miners are not locked into roles—they hold dual inventories of reasoning and skepticism.

The Portfolio Optimization Problem Miners must split capital between:

Proposer Inventory: Locked TAO backing reasoning trees (illiquid for duration of round + 2-hour challenge window)
Challenger Inventory: Liquid TAO available for immediate staking on targets of opportunity
Opportunity Cost: TAO locked in failed proposals cannot be used to challenge other miners' trees
Dynamic Rebalancing Heuristics:

Bull Market on Truth: When challenge success rates are low (<25%), shift 70% capital to Proposing (weak competition)
Bear Market on Truth: When challenge success rates are high (>60%), shift 80% capital to Challenging (predatory advantage)
Arbitrage Mode: If a miner detects their own reasoning flaw after submission but before external challenge, they can self-challenge (revealing the flaw honestly), paying the stake cost to prevent a competitor from claiming the 40% slashing reward—a "controlled demolition" strategy
Minimum Viable Miner Specifications
Stake Requirements

Entry Stake: 1,000 TAO minimum to register hotkey (prevents Sybil churn)
Active Capital: Must maintain 200 TAO liquid above the entry stake to file challenges or pay defense bonds
Slashing Insurance: Optional 50 TAO "umbrella" stake reduces slashing penalties by 25% (actuarial pool managed by validators)
Compute & Latency

Inference SLA: Proposers must generate <50 step reasoning trees within 300 seconds of problem publication
Challenge Latency: Challengers must submit counter-arguments within 30 minutes of challenge declaration (prevents compute grinding)
Storage: Must retain full reasoning plaintext for 7 days post-resolution for audit appeals (IPFS pinning required, verified via CID checks)
The Honest Minority Guardrail Even if 90% of miners collude to verify garbage reasoning, the 10% honest minority can profit infinitely:

Whistleblower Premium: Correct challenges against cabal-validated reasoning receive 2x the standard slashing reward (subsidized by Treasury)
Fork Option: If >51% of validators are compromised, minority validators can trigger a "Dissenting Adjudication," forcing the challenge to the next validator epoch with fresh jurors
The Miner Terminal State
Rational miners converge to a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium:

Morning Phase: Mine as Proposers (fresh problem sets, lower initial scrutiny)
Afternoon Phase: Switch to Challenger mode (archival trees available for audit, patterns of weakness visible)
Evening Phase: Validators rest; miners compute shadow proofs for tomorrow's adversarial landscape
Successful miners operate like Renaissance mercenary scholars: equally adept at constructing cathedrals of logic and laying siege to others' fortifications, allocating capital to whichever role offers higher Sharpe ratios of truth in the current epoch.
