High-Level Algorithm

1. Task Assignment (Round starts)
   └── Validator posts Problem P (math proof, legal analysis, code architecture)
       └── Difficulty scalar D set based on historical solve rates

2. Proposal Window (6 hours)
   └── Miners submit Solution S = {Final Answer A, Reasoning Tree R}
       └── R must be Merkleized with hash of each reasoning step

3. Challenge Window (6 hours)
   └── Challengers identify specific node(s) in R they dispute
       └── Stake TAO proportional to depth of challenge (deeper = cheaper to challenge, 
           as it signals high-confidence error detection)

4. Recursive Resolution (2 hours)
   └── If challenge raised:
       └── Proposer can Defend (provide sub-proof) or Concede
       └── Validators randomly sample debate branches for logical verification
       └── Decision requires 2/3 validator consensus on branch validity

5. Reward Allocation
   └── Winning side receives base emission + loser's stake (slashed)
   └── Validators rewarded for calibration (agreement with majority) not just participation
   └── Quality Bonus: Solutions that survive >3 challenges receive 2x multiplier
