Miner Design: The Cognitive Labor Layer

Miners in Dialectic operate as dual-role economic agents, dynamically allocating compute between generation (Proposing) and verification (Challenging) based on real-time market opportunities. Unlike standard inference subnets where miners merely respond to prompts, Dialectic miners participate in a temporal game tree that extends over 12-hour rounds.

Miner Tasks

Role A: The Proposer (Reasoning Architect)

Core Function: Generate novel, logically sound reasoning paths for complex open-ended problems while anticipating adversarial counter-arguments.

Specific Tasks:

Tree Construction: Build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of reasoning where each node represents an intermediate lemma, inference rule, or evidentiary citation. Root = final conclusion; leaves = axioms/premises.

Cryptographic Commitment: Hash each reasoning step using Keccak-256 to create a Merkle tree, committing only the root hash on-chain during the Proposal Phase (prevents plagiarism/late-copying while allowing verification).

Adversarial Fortification: Pre-emptively reinforce weak logical branches—miners must forecast where Challengers are likely to attack and either strengthen those nodes with additional citations or accept the risk of concentrated staking.

Defense Protocol: When challenged, optionally generate "sub-proofs" (deeper elaborations of specific lemmas) within a 2-hour response window, or concede the node to minimize slashing.

Role B: The Challenger (Logic Predator)

Core Function: Hunt for logical inconsistencies, factual errors, or epistemic gaps in competitor reasoning trees and monetize their detection.

Specific Tasks:

Selective Scanning: Parse archival reasoning trees (from current and previous rounds) using lightweight heuristics to identify high-value targets—steps with high confidence scores but weak evidentiary support.

Surgical Staking: Identify specific node IDs (UUIDs) in the Merkle tree to challenge, accompanied by a counter-argument and evidentiary payload. Stakes must cover: (a) the challenge deposit, (b) gas for on-chain challenge registration.

Exploitation Patterns:
Type 1 (Logical): Identify formal fallacies (affirming the consequent, circular reasoning)
Type 2 (Epistemic): Contest factual premises using real-time data oracles
Type 3 (Completeness): Argue that critical edge cases were ignored in the reasoning path

Critical Technical Constraint: During initial submission, content_plaintext is encrypted using the validator public key set, revealing only content_hash. This prevents Challengers from copying reasoning before staking. Decryption keys are released after the Challenge Phase opens, or upon first valid challenge to a specific node.

Performance Dimensions
Miners are ranked on a multi-dimensional efficacy score (0-10,000) updated after each round, determining emission allocation weight.

For Proposers
1. Adversarial Resilience Score (40% weight)


Resilience = (Challenges_Survived / Total_Challenges_Faced) * ln(Challenge_Value_Sum + 1)

Surviving high-stake challenges (>100 TAO) provides logarithmic score multipliers
Conceding quickly on weak nodes prevents score penalties vs. losing full challenges
"Immortal Proofs" Bonus: Reasoning trees surviving >5 unique challenges receive permanent 15% emission
