Validator Design: Adjudication Layer

Scoring and Evaluation Methodology
Stochastic Branch Verification (SBV) Validators don’t score full reasoning trees (too expensive). Instead:

Randomized Depth Sampling: When a challenge occurs at node N, validators randomly select k ancestral branches (where k = log₂(tree depth)) to verify logical consistency

Formal Logic Probes: Use lightweight SMT solvers (Z3) for mathematical claims,NLI models for semantic entailment in text-based reasoning

Adversarial Cross-Examination: Validators prompt miners with follow-up questions Q derived from challenged nodes; responses must maintain logical equivalence with original submission under perturbation

Scoring Function:

Validator_Score = (Calibration × 0.4) + (Efficiency × 0.3) + (Coverage × 0.3)

Where:
- Calibration = 1 - |Your_Vote - Consensus_Result| 
  (Penalized heavily for being wrong when consensus is strong >80%)
- Efficiency = 1 / (Compute_Cost × Time_to_Verify)
  (Faster verification with fewer LLM calls = higher score)
- Coverage = Unique_Branches_Verified / Total_Branches_Challenged
  (Prevents validators from only checking "easy" shallow nodes)

Consensus Mechanism:

Quadratic Voting: Validators stake TAO per decision; stake weight follows √stake to prevent whale dominance

Truth Latency Adjustment: If a validator is "early correct" (votes correctly before 67% threshold reached), they receive 1.5x emission multiplier for identifying truth before crowd consensus

Evaluation Cadence
Phased Verification Windows:

Preliminary Scan (Continuous): Validators run automated coherence checks (syntax, citation validity, basic logical fallacies) within 15 minutes of submission—filters obvious garbage before challenge phase

Challenge Arbitration (Event-driven): When a challenge is lodged, validators have 4-hour adjudication window to submit verdicts on disputed branches

Settlement Epochs (Every 12 hours): Batch processing of all resolved debates; reward distribution and slashing applied atomically

Appeal Quorum (Weekly): Top 5% most contested resolutions enter 48-hour secondary review by high-reputation validators (stake >1000 TAO), capable of overturning primary decisions with 75% supermajority (prevents 51% validator collusion)

Dynamic Evaluation Load:

Validators specify max_concurrent_verifications based on hardware; subnet automatically routes challenges to available validators using consistent hashing on problem_id

Cooldown Period: Validators cannot evaluate consecutive submissions from the same miner (prevents gaming through relationship building)

Validator Incentive Alignment

The "Skin in the Game" Slashing Conditions:

Consensus Divergence Penalty: If a validator votes against the eventual majority and the majority is >80% confident, they lose 5% of staked TAO to validators who voted correctly

Lazy Validation Detection: Validators who consistently vote "Agree" without submitting verification traces (ZK-proof of computation or signed API logs from LLM calls) receive exponentially decaying rewards (halving every epoch of lazy behavior)

Challenge Collusion Resistance: Validators who approve >3 challenges from the same challenger address within 24 hours trigger "Suspicion Mode"—their votes require higher consensus thresholds (90%) for 72 hours and their rewards are escrowed pending manual review by subnet owner

Long-term Alignment Mechanisms:

Reputation Decay: Validator effectiveness scores decay by 2% per day of inactivity; prevents "sleeping giant" validators from dominating emission history without current participation

Proportional Representation: Emissions weighted by stake × reputation_score × diversity_factor, where diversity_factor penalizes validators running identical models/configurations (ensures decentralized verification methodologies)

Treasury Alignment: Top 10% validators by accuracy gain governance rights over subnet hyperparameters (challenge window duration, minimum stake thresholds), aligning them with long-term subnet health rather than short-term extraction

Validator Attraction Design:

Hardware Gradient: Three validator tiers:
Scouts: Lightweight, check shallow logic (lower rewards, accessible to consumer GPUs)
Auditors: Deep verification with heavy LLMs (higher rewards, requires A100s)
Arbiters:Final appeal layer (highest stake requirement, monthly rotation to prevent stagnation)

This creates a "verification market" where validators specialize based on capital/hardware, preventing centralization while ensuring every reasoning branch faces economically-motivated scrutiny.
