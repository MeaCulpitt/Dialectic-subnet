Emission & Reward Logic: The Economic Engine of Adversarial Truth

Dialectic’s reward structure creates a zero-sum cognitive arena where TAO flows from flawed reasoning to valid criticism, with validators extracting rent for providing the arbitration layer.

1. The Base Emission Architecture
The 60/30/10 Triad From each block’s subnet emission (TAO/sec allocated by Yuma Consensus):

60% → Proposer Pool (Reasoning Generation)
30% → Challenger Pool (Adversarial Detection)
10% → Validator Pool (Adjudication Services)
Critical Distinction: Unlike standard subnets where miners compete for shared emissions based on performance scores, Dialectic operates a redistributive model where substantial portions of Proposer emissions are transferable to Challengers based on challenge outcomes.

2. Proposer Reward Mechanics

Base Rate Calculation


Daily_Proposer_Emission = (Subnet_TAO_Emission × 0.60) × (Resilience_Score / ΣResilience_Scores)

The Resilience Multiplier (R) The core scoring function for Proposers:


R = Base_Completion × Survival_Bonus × Immortality_Factor × Depth_Premium

Where:
- Base_Completion = 0.1 for submitting valid Merkle root, 0 otherwise
- Survival_Bonus = Σ(Challenge_Value_Survived / Challenge_Value_Total) for each round
- Immortality_Factor = 1.0 + (0.15 × max(0, Unique_Challengers - 3)) 
  [Capped at 2.0x for "Bulletproof" reasoning surviving >5 challengers]
- Depth_Premium = ln(Avg_Reasoning_Depth) / ln(10) 
  [Rewards complex multi-step logic over shallow chains]

Economic Example:

Alice submits a 20-step legal analysis (Depth: 20)
Survives challenges from 4 unique miners worth 400 TAO total
Bob submits a 5-step analysis (Depth: 5)
Survives 1 challenge worth 50 TAO
Alice receives ~4.2x the emission weight of Bob despite both "succeeding," incentivizing cognitive depth and adversarial fortification.

The "Blood in the Water" Penalty: If a Proposer concedes a challenge within 30 minutes (indicating low confidence), they retain 70% of base emissions but forfeit 30% to the Challenger immediately, bypassing validator adjudication (fast settlement).

3. Challenger Reward Mechanics: The Predatory Economy
Jackpot Architecture Challengers profit via stake capture, not just emission share.

Winning a Challenge:


Challenger_Payout = (Proposer_Stake_Slashed × 0.40) 
                    + (Challenge_Stake_Returned) 
                    + (Valuation_Bonus)

The Valuation Bonus: If a challenge reveals a critical flaw (defined as invalidating the root conclusion), the challenger receives a multiplier on the base emission pool:


Critical_Bonus = (30% Pool_Emission × 0.10) / Number_of_Critical_Findings

This creates "bug bounty" jackpots where finding a fatal logical error can yield 50-200 TAO in a single round.

Challenge Staking Tiers:

Depth 1-3 (Surface): 10 TAO minimum stake, 1.0x reward multiplier
Depth 4-7 (Structural): 25 TAO minimum, 1.5x multiplier
Depth 8+ (Foundational): 50 TAO minimum, 2.0x multiplier
Economic Rationale: Deep challenges require more effort to verify but target more valuable flaws (potentially collapsing entire reasoning trees), justifying higher stakes and returns.

Temporal Decay (Anti-Sniping):


Reward_Multiplier = Base × (0.95^Hours_Elapsed_Since_Challenge_Open)
Challengers earn 5% less per hour they wait to file. This prevents "vulture challenges" where miners wait for validators to signal consensus, then pile on. Early detection of flaws is heavily rewarded.

4. Validator Reward Mechanics: Calibration Markets
Validators are paid for accuracy of judgment, not volume of verification.

The Scoring Function:


Validator_Score = (Calibration × 0.60) + (Throughput × 0.25) + (Novelty × 0.15)
Calibration (60% weight):


Calibration = 1 - |Individual_Vote - Consensus_Result|^2

If validator votes WITH the eventual >67% majority: +1.0 score
If validator votes AGAINST strong consensus (>80% agreement): -2.0 score (heavy penalty for being confidently wrong)
If validator abstains: 0.0 (neutral, but frequent abstention triggers "Lazy Validator" slashing)

The Consensus Divergence Penalty: If a validator votes "Proposer Wins" but the consensus is "Challenger Wins" with >80% confidence:

Immediate: Forfeit 5% of staked validator TAO to winning-side voters

Persistent: Reputation score decays by 15% (affects future emission share for 7 days)

This creates "Skin in the Game" for adjudication—validators must be accurate or lose capital.

Throughput (25% weight): Validators must maintain a minimum verification rate (branches verified per hour) to prevent gaming by only voting on obvious cases.

Novelty (15% weight): Validators receive bonuses for being among the first 20% to correctly identify "edge case" challenges (those with 40-60% initial consensus uncertainty), incentivizing expertise in ambiguous logical territories.

5. Slashing & Redistribution Flows

The TAO Cycle:

Challenge Initiation: Challenger locks 50 TAO in escrow
Adversarial Resolution:
If Challenger Wins:
40% of Proposer's staked emission goes to Challenger
10% to Validators (as urgency bonus for swift adjudication)
50% burned or returned to subnet treasury (deflationary mechanism)
If Challenger Loses (frivolous challenge):
50% of Challenger stake burned
30% distributed to Proposer (pain compensation)
20% to Validators (compensation for wasted verification compute)

The Treasury Reinvestment: All burned TAO from slashing is redirected to a Subnet Treasury controlled by high-reputation validators, used for:

Genesis Grants: Bootstrapping new miners (first 30 days subsidized)
Bug Bounties: Rewards for finding exploits in the subnet mechanism itself
Cross-Subnet Integration: Paying other subnets to pipe data into Dialectic

6. Bootstrapping vs. Steady-State Economics

Phase 1: Genesis (Months 1-6)
Founder Subsidy: 25,000 TAO committed to guarantee minimum viable rewards
Guaranteed Minimum: Proposers earn at least 2 TAO/day regardless of external demand
Challenger Matching: Every challenge stake matched 1:1 by founder funds (doubles potential upside for early red-teamers)

Phase 2: Organic (Month 6+)
Fee Market Dominance: Client payments become >60% of total miner income
Deflationary Pressure: As TAO price appreciates, challenge stakes automatically adjust downward in TAO terms (peg to $USD via oracle) to maintain accessibility
Emission Saturation: Block rewards become "gravy" atop verification fees; subnet survives even if TAO emissions drop 90%
The Sustainability Checkpoint: The subnet achieves economic escape velocity when:


Daily_Client_Fees > (Daily_Emissions × 0.5)

At this threshold, the network is paying for its own security through utility, not inflation.

7. Anti-Gaming Safeguards
Sybil Resistance:

Stake-Weighted Expertise: Challenger rewards require minimum 100 TAO staked for 7 days before claiming "Critical Bonuses" (prevents churn-and-burn sock puppets)
